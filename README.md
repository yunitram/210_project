# My CPSC 210 Project

## Simple Tierlist Maker

What will the application do?

The application will be a simple tierlist maker with the
following functions and attributes
- UI will display a roster of anime characters and tiers 
from S to F
- User will be allowed to add/remove characters to tiers
- Users will be allowed to look into tiers to see the
characters currently added
- Users will be allowed to check features/traits of each
character
- Users will be allowed to view a 'presentation display' of 
the tierlist, which will show each tier and all characters
within it (like a normal tierlist)
- Users will also be allowed to rename the tiers (for example
changing 'S' to '**THE GOAT**')
- Users will be allowed to add tiers

Who will use it?

Why is this project of interest to you?

A tierlist is a creative format that lets
people share their opinions on a topic in a clear and 
concise way. Due to this, tierlists have become a popular
source of content for entertainers such as youtubers and
streamers, they're also something that I've found enjoyable
to create and discuss with friends. Due to the relevancy
of tierlists, and the personal interest I have in the subject,
I've decided to model my CPSC210 project after a tierlist
maker.
